# ✏️ Real-Time Character Counter

A simple web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to type a message into a text area while displaying a **real-time character counter**.  
The counter shows how many characters have been typed and how many remain, with a limit that prevents users from exceeding the maximum character count.

## 🚀 Features

- ⌨️ Live character count update as you type  
- 🚫 Prevents typing once the character limit is reached  
- ⚠️ Displays a warning message when the limit is exceeded  
- 🎨 Clean and responsive design using external CSS  
- ⚙️ JavaScript handles all dynamic behavior

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the text area and counter  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Real-time character counting logic  

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The user types a message into the text area.  
- The **JavaScript** script listens for `input` events.  
- It dynamically updates the counter to show the **number of characters typed** and the **remaining limit**.  
- If the limit is reached, typing stops and a **warning message** appears.
